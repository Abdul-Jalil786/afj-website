    "summary": "AFJ Limited operates in a fragmented but competitive UK transport market with 8 identified competitors across SEND school transport, NEPTS, minibus hire, and airport transfers. The competitive landscape shows mixed digital maturity: Travel SOS emerges as the most digitally visible direct competitor with strong SEO optimization for minibus hire in Birmingham, while Green Destinations appears dormant (domain for sale). Three competitors are inaccessible, suggesting either technical issues, inactive operations, or minimal digital presence. AJ Travel and HS2 Travel serve indirect competition in the coach/tour space. AFJ's opportunity lies in leveraging superior digital presence and service specialization (SEND/NEPTS focus) against fragmented, poorly-resourced competitors.",

      "Create regional service pages for Greater Manchester and surrounding areas to capture expansion into AJ Travel's addressable market; include local testimonials and location-specific content",
      "Monitor Green Destinations domain transfer: if acquired by competitor or reactivated, implement competitive ad strategy (branded SEM campaigns) to recapture search traffic",
