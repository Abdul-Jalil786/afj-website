    "summary": "The competitive landscape shows a fragmented market of 8 direct and indirect competitors in the West Midlands transport sector. Travel SOS emerges as the primary direct competitor with a well-optimized online presence targeting minibus hire and school transport—core AFJ services. Green Destinations appears to be a domain-for-sale listing rather than an active competitor. Several competitors (Smart Kids Group, Aziz Coach Service, Aston Manor Coaches) have inaccessible websites, suggesting either technical issues or dormant operations, reducing immediate competitive pressure. AJ Travel and HS2 Travel are indirect competitors operating across broader geographies (London/Manchester focus), with limited regional threat. Travel SOS's recent website update signals active market engagement and optimization.",

      "Response time competition: Match or beat Travel SOS's 2-hour response commitment with enhanced customer service guarantees",

      "Enhance local search presence: Claim and optimize Google Business Profile for all service areas (Birmingham, Manchester, surrounding regions); competitors show weak local SEO",
      "Build thought leadership: Publish content on school transport regulations, accessibility standards, and NEPTS best practices to establish authority over generalist competitors",
      "Implement reputation management: Solicit and showcase reviews on Google, Trustpilot for SEND and NEPTS services—fewer competitors visible on review sites",
      "Monitor Travel SOS activity: Set up weekly alerts for their website changes; their recent update suggests competitive escalation in this segment",
      "Develop premium positioning assets: Create case studies, testimonial videos, and service-level guarantees for executive and airport transfer segments",
