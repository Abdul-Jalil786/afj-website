  "contentFreshness": {
    "assessment": "Critical Gaps. All 16 blog posts lack publication dates, making it impossible to assess freshness or SEO performance. No dated content calendar exists (0 entries). Given the current date is February 2026, it is likely that several posts are stale (12+ months old or undated legacy content). Missing seasonal content (winter NEPTS demand, summer holiday SEND scheduling). No recent compliance or regulatory updates. CSR and awards posts suggest some internal content strategy, but lacking rhythm and keyword targeting.",
    "recommendation": "Immediate Actions: (1) Audit all 16 posts—add publication dates, identify which are >6 months old and require refresh/update. (2) Implement dated, SEO-optimized publishing schedule: 2–3 blog posts per month (alternating SEND, NEPTS, executive hire, fleet maintenance, recruitment themes). (3) Create a content calendar for Q1–Q4 2026 with seasonal hooks (Q1: winter/compliance, Q2: summer holiday planning, Q3: school term & recruitment, Q4: tender season & year-end). (4) Establish ownership & publishing cadence (e.g., 1st & 3rd Tuesday of month). (5) Refresh 5–6 highest-performing legacy posts with current data, client quotes, and 2026 regulatory context."
  },
  "overallAssessment": "AFJ's content library is broad but disorganized and stale. Sixteen blog posts span relevant topics (SEND, NEPTS, compliance, maintenance, recruitment, technology, CSR), demonstrating strong topical understanding. However, the absence of publication dates, zero content calendar entries, and no clear publishing rhythm suggest ad-hoc content creation rather than strategic marketing. Critical gaps exist in vehicle conversions, airport transfers, localized council case studies, and 2026 compliance updates. The brand is underutilizing its operational strengths—700+ daily students, 47 drivers, multi-council partnerships, award recognition—in content storytelling.\n\nRecommendation: Establish a structured content strategy with a dated, SEO-optimized publishing calendar (2–3 posts/month). Prioritize high-impact topics: compliance updates, multi-service case studies, council/NHS partnership narratives, and driver/recruitment stories. Refresh legacy posts with current data and dates. Develop location-specific content for Sandwell, Manchester, and Birmingham markets. Align social media (LinkedIn for B2B councils/NHS, Facebook for parents) with blog cadence. This shift will improve organic visibility, build thought leadership, and support tender qualification narratives."
