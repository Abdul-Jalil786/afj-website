    "assessment": "Content age is unknown (no publication dates recorded), suggesting either outdated blog or poor content management practices. 16 blog posts across 8+ service lines indicates reasonable breadth but no documented publishing cadence. Zero content calendar entries indicate ad-hoc approach rather than strategic planning. No recent content on 2024 awards, current council partnerships, or pressing issues (NHS discharge crisis, cost-of-living impact on families needing transport). Blog appears static rather than active resource.",
    "recommendation": "Immediately: (1) Audit existing blog publication dates and remove outdated content; (2) create content calendar for next 12 months with minimum 2 posts/month; (3) publish 4–6 priority high-impact pieces (SEND, compliance, case studies, NEPTS) within 60 days. Medium-term: Establish editorial rhythm of 1–2 posts weekly, repurposing into LinkedIn articles, email content, and social snippets. Implement blog update calendar to refresh evergreen pieces quarterly with fresh data, updated links, and current client testimonials."
  },
  "overallAssessment": "AFJ has created a solid foundation with 16 blog posts spanning its core services, but the content strategy lacks strategic focus, publication discipline, and urgency-driven updates. Critical gaps exist in B2B decision-making content (compliance, case studies, business continuity), SEND specialisation (despite being a flagship service), and talent acquisition. The blog is not fully leveraged to support its three main customer segments: councils (procurement), NHS trusts (NEPTS), and private customers (minibus hire). Without publication dates and a content calendar, it's unclear whether content is actively maintained or attracting organic search traffic."
