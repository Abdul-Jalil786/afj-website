Attracting and retaining skilled workers in the UK's transport sector is vital for ensuring consistent, high-quality service delivery, especially as the industry faces significant challenges from labor shortages and high employee turnover rates. The UK transport and logistics sector employs over 1.5 million people, but with a turnover rate as high as 25% in some areas, maintaining a stable workforce can be challenging. This turnover, along with projected growth in demand, especially for passenger and freight transport, highlights an urgent need for strategies focused on workforce sustainability.

### The Importance of Qualifications and Skill Development

To operate in passenger and goods transport roles, employees require specific qualifications. For instance, a Driver Certificate of Professional Competence (Driver CPC) is mandatory for bus, coach, and lorry drivers. Further qualifications like the National Vocational Training (NVT) concession may be required for those in advanced roles. For management and planning roles, degrees in logistics or business management are often preferred, and roles like air traffic control or engineering may require advanced certifications and training.

Continual professional development is crucial for both retaining staff and ensuring the safety and quality of services. Institutions like The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT) and sector-specific apprenticeships play a crucial role in building and updating skills, aligning with ongoing industry changes and regulatory demands.

### Challenges in the Transport Sector

Recruitment challenges are heightened by the aging workforce, particularly in the bus and coach sector, where the average driver age is around 56. The industry also has fewer younger workers joining, partly due to the perception of long, irregular hours and demanding working conditions. Additionally, as transport services are highly customer-facing, strong interpersonal skills, patience, and flexibility are necessary but sometimes challenging to cultivate under current employment pressures.

In the absence of skilled, stable employees, service reliability can suffer, impacting public confidence. Unreliable services due to staffing gaps can lead to lost revenue and increased

operational costs, not to mention a strain on existing staff. With an estimated 90,000 driver vacancies across various transport sectors in the UK, the need for efficient retention strategies is more pressing than ever.

### Retention Strategies for a Sustainable Workforce

Effective retention strategies are vital in mitigating high turnover. Competitive salaries, ongoing professional development opportunities, and clear pathways for career advancement can attract new entrants and retain existing staff. Offering apprenticeships and on-the-job training not only meets staffing needs but also builds a sense of loyalty and growth within the organization. For example, flexible working schedules can make the industry more appealing to a younger workforce and reduce burnout among current employees.

Companies in the UK transport sector that emphasize well-being and work-life balance are also seeing better retention rates. Research shows that companies with structured career development and a strong organizational culture are more likely to retain employees for longer durations.

### Industry Outlook and Job Growth

The demand for qualified transport professionals is expected to grow, especially with initiatives to increase sustainability and digital transformation within the industry. While roles in logistics and public transport management offer steady income and career growth, recruitment continues to be competitive. Large transport firms and SMEs alike are expected to implement strategic recruitment initiatives that focus on fostering career progression and training within their organizations.

Overall, addressing the needs of the workforce through competitive pay, structured training programs, and meaningful benefits is essential for the UK transport sector to attract and retain the qualified staff necessary for reliable, safe, and efficient services.

## Strategic Partnerships and Talent Pipelines

To address potential workforce shortages, partnering with local training institutions, driving schools, and community organizations can help build a talent pipeline. Offering internships or apprenticeships, for example, can bring in fresh talent and help trainees become familiar

with company operations. Internally, companies can consider implementing employee referral programs, offering incentives to current staff who help recruit qualified candidates.

By focusing on these strategies, transport companies can build a skilled and reliable workforce, ensuring that service reliability remains high and customer satisfaction is met. AFJ emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive approach to workforce management, blending competitive compensation, training, and a supportive work culture to create an appealing employment proposition that stands out in a competitive job market.
