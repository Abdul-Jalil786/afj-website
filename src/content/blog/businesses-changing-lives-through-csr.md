**Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) **is the moral compass guiding modern businesses. CSR is more than a trend; it’s a commitment to making a positive impact. CSR emphasizes that companies aren’t isolated entities; they’re intertwined with society. Companies embracing CSR understand that success isn’t solely measured by profits but also by the contributions they make to society. Beyond profit-making, these companies prioritize making a positive impact on society and the environment. They believe in doing well by doing good, fostering a culture of responsibility and empathy. For entities like AFJ, CSR serves as a compass, directing their efforts towards meaningful engagement and community betterment.

WHY IS CSR IMPORTANT?

At its core, CSR represents a commitment to ethical practices, social consciousness, and sustainable development. Companies embracing CSR recognize their role as key stakeholders in societal progress. They acknowledge their influence on societal and environmental factors. They make sure to do things ethically. It’s not just about making their brand look good; it’s also about helping communities and the environment. They take responsibility for their actions to leave a positive mark and build trust among everyone involved.

## IS CSR AN ADDITIONAL EXPENSE FOR ORGANISATIONS?

CSR isn’t just about giving; it’s also about gaining. As people increasingly value social and environmental efforts, CSR becomes a powerful asset for companies. It’s not an expense—it’s an investment that brings returns. By prioritizing CSR, companies enhance their reputation, attract loyal customers, engage motivated employees, and draw in investors. It’s a strategy that benefits everyone involved and produces a Win- Win scenario for all parties, making it a smart move for all organisations to actively engage in and let all the stakeholders (organisation, society and environment) benefit from CSR initiatives.

## 1) CLEANERGREENER STREETS:
REVIVING NECHELLS BIRMINGHAM

AFJ partnered with Birmingham City Council’s CleanerGreenerStreets   Campaign to clean up Nechells Birmingham. Over 50 AFJ volunteers joined forces along with the councillor of Nechells, collecting 51 bags of debris. The volunteers who dedicated their time didn’t just collect bags of trash; they connected with locals,   sparking conversations about the importance of a cleaner environment and distributed leaflets to generate awareness about the same.

## 2) STOPLOANSHARKS CAMPAIGN:
SHIELDING COMMUNITIES FROM ILLEGAL MONEY LENDING

Illegal money lending has been an ongoing problem throughout UK and the outcomes are often life threatening. Statistics states that over 3 million people in Great Britain may have borrowed from an illegal moneylender in the last three years according to new research by IPSOS for Fair4All Finance.

AFJ has collaborated with England’s Illegal Money Lending Team(IMLT) and have had internal trainings around StopLoanSharks campaign to educate our resources on the same. However, this is just the first step towards a greater cause. With the educated and informed resources, AFJ has started making the people across Greater Birmingham and Greater Manchester aware of the issue and providing them measures, support and guidance on how to come out of it. These events are empowering sessions, equipping individuals with knowledge to recognize and evade predatory lending practices. AFJ plans on eradicating this problem to the maximum extent possible by it’s continuous efforts with the England’s IMLT. The vinyl posters on AFJ buses, the leaflets that every AFJ drivers and assistants hand over to the people is a step forward towards spreading awareness and letting any possible victim step out of these traps in a guided way.
