As the UK intensifies efforts to achieve its ambitious net-zero emissions targets, every industry and individual has a role to play in reducing environmental impact. However, one overlooked contributor to pollution and resource waste is poor vehicle maintenance. Neglecting regular servicing and checks not only compromises safety and efficiency but also significantly increases the environmental footprint of vehicles. In a nation where road transport accounts for 27% of greenhouse gas emissions, according to the UK Department for Transport (DfT), responsible vehicle upkeep is more important than ever.

**1. Establish Specialized Processes for SEND Transportation**

Providers must establish tailored systems and expertise to address the unique requirements of transporting SEND students. This includes creating comprehensive workflows to accommodate the diverse needs of these students, ensuring a reliable and supportive service. By focusing on specialized training for drivers and passenger assistants, providers can better address medical, behavioral, or mobility challenges. Investing in adaptive technologies and fostering a feedback culture with councils and parents can further enhance service quality, ensuring SEND students are transported safely and with dignity.

**The Environmental Cost of Neglecting Maintenance**

**1. Rising Emissions from Poorly Maintained Vehicles**

Faulty or neglected vehicle systems can significantly increase emissions. For example, a malfunctioning exhaust system or worn-out catalytic converter allows harmful gases such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) to escape into the atmosphere. According to Transport for London (TfL), emissions from poorly maintained vehicles contribute to over 9,000 premature deaths annually in the UK linked to air pollution.

**2. Increased Fuel Consumption**

Vehicles with underinflated tyres, misaligned wheels, or poorly performing engines consume more fuel than necessary. For UK drivers, this not only means higher costs at the pump but also greater carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The Energy Saving Trust estimates that keeping tyres properly inflated can improve fuel efficiency by up to 5%, translating into substantial environmental and financial savings.

**3. Oil and Fluid Leaks Contaminating Waterways**

Leaks of motor oil, coolant, and other fluids from neglected vehicles can seep into the ground and local water systems, causing pollution. In the UK, where protecting waterways is a government priority under the Environment Act 2021, these leaks pose significant ecological threats.

**4. Resource Waste from Premature Vehicle Wear**

Poor maintenance accelerates wear and tear on components, leading to increased replacement needs. This creates a demand for more manufacturing and disposal of parts, which intensifies resource extraction and waste production.

**Maintenance Checklist for Drivers**

Drivers can take proactive steps to minimise their vehicle’s environmental impact:

- **Annual MOTs (Ministry of Transport tests):** Ensure your vehicle complies with UK road safety and environmental standards by scheduling annual MOT tests.

- **Regular Servicing:** Follow manufacturer-recommended schedules for oil changes, filter replacements, and engine tune-ups.

- **Tyre Maintenance:** Check tyre pressure monthly and ensure tyres meet the legal tread depth requirement of 1.6mm.

- **Emission Testing:** Test emissions regularly to ensure your vehicle meets Euro 6 standards, now mandatory in Low Emission Zones (LEZ) and Ultra Low Emission Zones (ULEZ) across the UK.

- **Check Fluids:** Monitor and refill essential fluids like brake fluid, coolant, and transmission fluid to avoid leaks and overheating.

- **Battery and Exhaust Systems:** Test battery efficiency and inspect the exhaust for leaks or blockages, which can lead to excessive emissions.
