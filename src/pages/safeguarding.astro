      <p class="text-afj-secondary leading-relaxed">
        This policy applies to all AFJ Limited employees, drivers, passenger assistants, agency workers, and subcontractors involved in the delivery of our transport services.

            Every member of staff — drivers, passenger assistants, office staff, and management — undergoes an enhanced DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) check before they begin working with us. DBS checks are renewed regularly, and we subscribe to the DBS Update Service for continuous monitoring.

      <h2 class="text-afj-green">Recognising Abuse and Neglect</h2>
      <p class="text-afj-secondary leading-relaxed">
        All staff are trained to recognise the signs and indicators of abuse, including:
      </p>
      <ul class="text-afj-secondary">
        <li><strong>Physical abuse:</strong> unexplained injuries, bruising, burns, or fractures</li>
        <li><strong>Emotional abuse:</strong> withdrawn behaviour, excessive fear, low self-esteem</li>
        <li><strong>Sexual abuse:</strong> inappropriate sexual behaviour or knowledge, reluctance to be alone with specific individuals</li>
        <li><strong>Neglect:</strong> persistent hunger, poor hygiene, inappropriate clothing for the weather, untreated medical conditions</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-afj-secondary leading-relaxed">
        Staff are also trained to be aware of additional vulnerabilities that students with SEND may face, including communication difficulties that may make it harder to disclose abuse, dependency on caregivers, and susceptibility to bullying.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-afj-green">How to Raise a Concern</h2>
      <p class="text-afj-secondary leading-relaxed">
        If you have a safeguarding concern about a student or vulnerable adult using our services, you can report it through the following channels:
      </p>
      <ol class="text-afj-secondary">
        <li><strong>Contact our designated safeguarding lead</strong> by calling <a href="tel:01216891000" class="text-afj-sky-blue hover:text-afj-accent">0121 689 1000</a> and asking for the safeguarding lead, or emailing <a href="mailto:info@afjltd.co.uk" class="text-afj-sky-blue hover:text-afj-accent">info@afjltd.co.uk</a> marked "Safeguarding — Confidential".</li>
        <li><strong>Contact the relevant local authority</strong> children's services or adult safeguarding team directly if you believe a child or vulnerable adult is at immediate risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Call the police on 999</strong> if you believe someone is in immediate danger.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="text-afj-secondary leading-relaxed">
        All concerns are taken seriously and treated in confidence. We have a strict no-retaliation policy — anyone who raises a safeguarding concern in good faith will be fully supported.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-afj-green">Staff Code of Conduct</h2>
      <p class="text-afj-secondary leading-relaxed">
        All AFJ Limited staff working with students and vulnerable adults are bound by our code of conduct, which includes:
      </p>
      <ul class="text-afj-secondary">
        <li>Maintaining professional boundaries at all times</li>
        <li>Never being alone with a student in circumstances that could be misinterpreted</li>
        <li>Never exchanging personal contact details (phone numbers, social media) with students or their families</li>
        <li>Never using personal mobile phones to photograph or record students</li>
        <li>Reporting any concerns immediately — never investigating independently</li>
        <li>Never physically restraining a passenger unless there is an immediate risk of harm</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-afj-green">Record Keeping and Confidentiality</h2>
      <p class="text-afj-secondary leading-relaxed">
        All safeguarding concerns, allegations, and related actions are documented and stored securely in accordance with data protection legislation. Records are retained for the period specified by statutory guidance and are only shared on a need-to-know basis or where required by law.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-afj-green">Policy Review</h2>
      <p class="text-afj-secondary leading-relaxed">
        This safeguarding policy is reviewed annually or following any significant incident or change in legislation. All staff are notified of any updates and receive additional training where necessary.
      </p>
