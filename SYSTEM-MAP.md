- `.github/workflows/broken-links.yml` — Weekly broken link checker (linkinator, GitHub issue)
- `.github/workflows/deploy-validate.yml` — Post-deploy validation (8 pages, sitemap, Resend alerts)
- `scripts/image-audit.mjs` — Image optimization audit (scan >500KB, WebP conversion via sharp)
- Accessibility fixes: skip-to-content link, ServiceCard alt text, Footer ARIA, CookieBanner focus management

### Phase 9.6 — Accessibility Hardening (2026-02-16)
- **Desktop dropdown keyboard support** — Header.astro Services dropdown now opens with Enter/Space/ArrowDown, navigates with ArrowUp/ArrowDown, closes with Escape; `aria-haspopup` and `aria-expanded` attributes added to trigger link; focus traps within dropdown, focusout closes it
- **Mobile menu Escape handler** — pressing Escape closes mobile menu and restores focus to hamburger button
- **Color contrast fix** — Footer bottom bar changed from `text-gray-400` to `text-gray-300` for WCAG AA compliance on dark background
- **Form validation aria-live** — field-level error messages in ContactForm.astro and quote wizard now have `aria-live="polite"` for screen reader announcements
- **FleetGallery lightbox ARIA** — lightbox overlay now has `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, `aria-label="Image lightbox"`
- **FAQ focus-visible styles** — toggle buttons now show `focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-afj-accent` for keyboard users
- **Hero decorative SVG** — arrow icon in "Read More" link marked `aria-hidden="true"`; chevron in desktop nav dropdown also marked `aria-hidden="true"`
- **Admin navigation ARIA** — desktop nav gets `aria-label="Admin navigation"`, mobile nav changed from `<div>` to `<nav>` with `aria-label="Admin navigation mobile"`

### Phase 9.5 — Admin Fixes (2026-02-16)
- **Apply Change button functional** — `/admin/pages` Apply Change now commits to GitHub via new `POST /api/admin/page-apply` endpoint (was showing fake success message)
- **Department config hardened** — `getDepartment()` fallback returns `unknown` role with no privileges (was incorrectly granting management access to unrecognised emails); `_comment` added to `departments.json` explaining empty email arrays need populating on staff onboarding
- **Audit logging** — new `src/lib/audit-log.ts` utility, append-only JSON log at `data/audit-log.json` (gitignored); hooked into `blog/create`, `page-edit` (preview), `page-apply`, and `approval` (submit/approve/reject)

### Phase 9.4 — Security Hardening (2026-02-16)
- **Auth bypass fixes** — `/api/ai/test` and `/api/blog/create` now accept Cloudflare Access JWT (`Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion`) alongside `x-dashboard-secret`, matching the dual-auth pattern used by other protected endpoints
- **XSS escaping in email templates** — `escapeHtml()` applied to all user-provided values (title, reason, name, email, phone, message) before embedding in HTML email bodies in `/api/admin/approval` and `/api/contact/submit`
- **Role-based permission on page-edit** — `/api/ai/page-edit` now checks department from CF JWT; only `management` and `marketing` roles can use the endpoint (returns 403 for others)
- **File path exposure removed** — `/api/ai/page-edit` error responses use generic message instead of exposing server file paths

### Phase 9.3 — Pricing Bug Fixes (2026-02-16)
- **WAIT return deadhead fix** — return leg now uses base→destination distance (`destDeadhead`) instead of base→pickup; total WAIT miles use `deadhead + destDeadhead` instead of `deadhead × 2`
- **Airport arrival waiting rate fix** — uses charge-out rate (£17/hr) instead of driver wage (£13/hr), consistent with all other waiting time calculations
- **Per-leg minimum floor for different-day returns** — minimum fare (£35 private hire / £45 airport) now applies independently to each leg of a `separate` return, not to the combined total
- **DVSA passenger range parsing fix** — `parseInt("9-16")` was returning 9; now extracts maximum value from hyphenated ranges (e.g. "9-16" → 16)
- **DVSA break on one-way trips** — 45-minute break surcharge for 9+ passengers now applies to one-way trips too, not just WAIT returns

### Phase 9.2 — Pricing Refactor + Admin Cost Portal (2026-02-16)
- **Cost-based pricing model** for private hire — replaces baseFare + perMileRate with two admin-configurable inputs:
  - `costPerMile` (£0.45) — combined fuel + wear + insurance + depreciation + compliance
  - `chargeOutRatePerHour` (£17) — what we charge clients per driver hour (vs £13 driver wage)
- **Three-tier return pricing** for private hire:
  - **Split**: pickup near base + gap ≥ minGapForSplitReturnHours → driver returns to base between legs, zero waiting charge
  - **Wait**: pickup far from base OR short gap → driver stays at destination, waiting time charged at charge-out rate
  - **Separate**: different-day return → two independent bookings, surcharges applied per-leg based on each leg's date/time
- **Deadhead rolled into journey miles** — no separate "Driver travel from base" line; deadhead miles/hours included in Journey line
- **Admin pricing portal** at `/admin/pricing` — management-only, 7 sections:
  1. Core Pricing (costPerMile, chargeOutRate, driverWage + margin display)
  2. Operational Thresholds (deadhead threshold, min gap for split return)
  3. Minimum Booking Floors (private hire, airport)
  4. Passenger Multipliers (editable per band)
  5. Surcharges (editable percentages)
  6. Bank Holiday Dates (add/remove)
  7. DVSA Compliance (break threshold, duration, min passengers)
  8. Quote Preview panel (test quotes with current saved values)
- **API endpoints**: `GET /api/admin/pricing` (read config), `POST /api/admin/pricing` (write via GitHub API)
- **Airport transfers unchanged** — keeps fixed-rate model with airport rates table
- Updated passenger multipliers: 17-24 → 1.6 (was 1.7), 25-33 → 2.0 (was 2.1)
- DVSA config moved to top-level `dvsa` object (breakThresholdHours, breakDurationMinutes, minimumPassengers)

### Phase 9.1 — Quote Wizard Overhaul (2026-02-15/16)
- **Postcode/city autocomplete** on quote form text inputs via Postcodes.io API
  - Routing heuristic: `/^[A-Z]{1,2}\d/i` → postcode autocomplete endpoint; else → places search endpoint
  - Debounced 300ms, keyboard navigation (arrows, Enter, Escape), up to 8 suggestions
- **Real driving mileage** via Postcodes.io (lat/lng) + OSRM (road routing)
  - Replaces hardcoded 12-area distance matrix as primary distance source
  - Matrix retained as fallback when APIs fail
- **Driver hours pricing model** replacing flat 1.75x return multiplier for private hire:
  - **Same-day return**: outbound + return mileage + waiting time at £13/hr + deadhead + DVSA break
  - **Different-day return**: two one-way trips + double deadhead, return date + pickup time
  - **One-way**: unchanged core formula + deadhead if applicable
- **Driver deadhead from base**: nearest base (Birmingham B7 4JD / Manchester M35 0BR) → pickup; £13/hr x round trip if >30 miles
- **DVSA compliance**: 45-min break surcharge for 9+ passengers when total driving >4.5 hours
- **Conditional form fields** (`showWhen` system) — questions appear/hide based on other field values
  - Pickup time as actual time input, return journey reveals: same-day toggle, return pickup time, return date
- **Enterprise portal** — "Enterprise / Contract" badge, e-portal CTA, dynamic per-service descriptions
- **Luggage & accessibility**: luggage dropdown (none/light/heavy), wheelchair toggle for both services
- **Peak surcharges**: early morning (<07:00, +15%), late night (>22:00, +15%), Saturday (+10%), Sunday (+20%), bank holiday (+50%) — time + day/holiday stack additively
- **Multi-stop support**: up to 2 stops with postcode autocomplete, distance chained via OSRM, 10-min waiting per stop
- **Regular booking discount**: 10% off for recurring bookings (private-hire only)
- **Airport enhancements**: arrival/departure toggle (45-min waiting cost), executive vehicle class (+30% base), custom toggle labels
- **Minimum booking floors**: private-hire £35, airport £45
- **Itemised quote breakdown**: full cost breakdown table in Step 3
  - Line items: base journey, return, deadhead, waiting, DVSA break, stops, meet & greet, arrival waiting
  - Subtotal, surcharges (amber), regular discount (green), estimated total, price range
  - Flags: heavy luggage, wheelchair accessible, executive vehicle badges
- **Custom toggle labels** (`toggleLabels`) for "One-off"/"Regular", "Departure"/"Arrival" etc.
- **Competitive protection** — school names removed from area pages; replaced with regional SEND capability statements (e.g. "specialist SEND transport across the West Midlands"). Company-wide stats only (700+ students, 18+ years). Hospital names kept (public knowledge).
- **Contact form service pre-fill** — enterprise portal CTA links to `/contact?service=Service+Name`; ContactForm.astro reads the `service` URL parameter and pre-fills the message textarea with "I would like to request a consultation for [Service Name]."

### Phase 10 — Full Codebase Audit & Cleanup (2026-02-16/17)

- London postcode areas (E, EC, N, NW, SE, SW, W, WC) mapped to LDN key
- Airport rates added for S, LS, LDN areas
- City lookup updated: sheffield→S, leeds→LS, london→LDN

**SEO fixes (4 issues):**
- Blog route: `[...slug].astro` → `[slug].astro` (prevents nested path matches)
- Blog post rendering: `post.render()` → `render(post)` (Astro v5 API)
- Blog slug resolution: `post.slug || post.id` (Astro v5 glob loader compat)
- Admin pages: `noindex, nofollow` meta tag via AdminLayout
- Blog index schema: `CollectionPage` with `ItemList` (done in prior session)

    → Postcodes.io (lat/lng) + OSRM (driving distance/duration) [fallback: hardcoded matrix]
    → Multi-stop: chains distance through up to 2 intermediate stops
    → Private hire: cost-per-mile + charge-out-rate model
      → One-way: journey miles × £/mi + driving hours × £/hr (deadhead rolled in if >30mi from base)
      → Same-day return: SPLIT (driver returns to base, no waiting) or WAIT (driver stays, waiting charged)
        → Split conditions: pickup within deadhead threshold + gap ≥ 5 hours
      → Different-day return: two separate bookings, surcharges per-leg
    → Airport: fixed-rate model from airportRates table (unchanged)
    → Applies: passenger multiplier → surcharges (time/day/bank holiday) → regular discount → minimum floor → range spread
    → Returns: full itemised breakdown + price range + return type indicator
  → Estimate screen: journey/return/waiting/DVSA line items + flags + split return message
  → Customer can submit full quote request → Web3Forms → info@afjltd.co.uk

  → quote-log.ts appends to data/quote-log.jsonl (async, fire-and-forget)

Weekly (Sunday 22:00 UTC via GitHub Actions):
  → scripts/market-research-agent.mjs
    → Reads quote-rules.json (current pricing) + quote-log.jsonl (last 7 days)
    → Calls Anthropic Haiku with structured analysis prompt
    → Generates recommendations, tier analysis, minimum floor analysis
    → Saves to src/data/reports/pricing-report.json
    → Git commit + push → Railway auto-deploy

Admin review:
  → /admin/pricing-intelligence → view recommendations + metrics
    → "Test This" → runs 5 standard journeys via /api/quote/estimate
    → Approve → PUT /api/admin/pricing-report (marks approved)
    → Reject → PUT /api/admin/pricing-report (marks rejected + optional reason)

Manual conversion tracking:
  → /admin/conversions → view all quotes
    → Mark converted (booking value) or lost (reason) → PUT /api/admin/conversions
    → Add phone booking → POST /api/admin/conversions
```

### Automated Monitoring Pipeline (Current)

## 6. Security Model

### Authentication
| Route Pattern | Auth Method | Who |
|---------------|------------|-----|
| `/admin/*` | Cloudflare Zero Trust (email-based) | AFJ managers by department |
| `/api/*` (from admin) | Cloudflare Access JWT (verified via jose JWKS) | Authenticated managers |
| `/api/*` (programmatic) | `DASHBOARD_SECRET` header | Automated scripts, Claude Code |
| `/api/contact/submit` | Rate limited (5/15min per IP) | Public |
| `/api/quote/estimate` | Rate limited (30/15min per IP) + field validation | Public |
| `/image-library` | Cloudflare Zero Trust | Jay only |
| `/content-calendar` | Cloudflare Zero Trust | Jay only |
| All other routes | Public | Everyone |

All API endpoints validate request body size (50KB default, 200KB for large content).
All admin API endpoints use `authenticateRequest()` from `src/lib/cf-auth.ts`.
All responses include security headers via `src/middleware.ts` (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy).

### Secret Management
- All secrets stored as Railway environment variables (never committed to repo)
- `DASHBOARD_SECRET` rotated quarterly
- GitHub PAT scoped to repo-only access
- LLM API keys have usage limits set at provider level

### Data Protection
- No user data stored in the repository
- Contact form submissions go directly to Web3Forms (GDPR compliant)
- Cloudflare handles SSL termination
- No cookies beyond essential GDPR consent cookie and Cloudflare access cookie
