- `.github/workflows/broken-links.yml` — Weekly broken link checker (linkinator, GitHub issue)
- `.github/workflows/deploy-validate.yml` — Post-deploy validation (8 pages, sitemap, Resend alerts)
- `scripts/image-audit.mjs` — Image optimization audit (scan >500KB, WebP conversion via sharp)
- Accessibility fixes: skip-to-content link, ServiceCard alt text, Footer ARIA, CookieBanner focus management

### Phase 9.6 — Accessibility Hardening (2026-02-16)
- **Desktop dropdown keyboard support** — Header.astro Services dropdown now opens with Enter/Space/ArrowDown, navigates with ArrowUp/ArrowDown, closes with Escape; `aria-haspopup` and `aria-expanded` attributes added to trigger link; focus traps within dropdown, focusout closes it
- **Mobile menu Escape handler** — pressing Escape closes mobile menu and restores focus to hamburger button
- **Color contrast fix** — Footer bottom bar changed from `text-gray-400` to `text-gray-300` for WCAG AA compliance on dark background
- **Form validation aria-live** — field-level error messages in ContactForm.astro and quote wizard now have `aria-live="polite"` for screen reader announcements
- **FleetGallery lightbox ARIA** — lightbox overlay now has `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, `aria-label="Image lightbox"`
- **FAQ focus-visible styles** — toggle buttons now show `focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-afj-accent` for keyboard users
- **Hero decorative SVG** — arrow icon in "Read More" link marked `aria-hidden="true"`; chevron in desktop nav dropdown also marked `aria-hidden="true"`
- **Admin navigation ARIA** — desktop nav gets `aria-label="Admin navigation"`, mobile nav changed from `<div>` to `<nav>` with `aria-label="Admin navigation mobile"`

### Phase 9.5 — Admin Fixes (2026-02-16)
- **Apply Change button functional** — `/admin/pages` Apply Change now commits to GitHub via new `POST /api/admin/page-apply` endpoint (was showing fake success message)
- **Department config hardened** — `getDepartment()` fallback returns `unknown` role with no privileges (was incorrectly granting management access to unrecognised emails); `_comment` added to `departments.json` explaining empty email arrays need populating on staff onboarding
- **Audit logging** — new `src/lib/audit-log.ts` utility, append-only JSON log at `data/audit-log.json` (gitignored); hooked into `blog/create`, `page-edit` (preview), `page-apply`, and `approval` (submit/approve/reject)

### Phase 9.4 — Security Hardening (2026-02-16)
- **Auth bypass fixes** — `/api/ai/test` and `/api/blog/create` now accept Cloudflare Access JWT (`Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion`) alongside `x-dashboard-secret`, matching the dual-auth pattern used by other protected endpoints
- **XSS escaping in email templates** — `escapeHtml()` applied to all user-provided values (title, reason, name, email, phone, message) before embedding in HTML email bodies in `/api/admin/approval` and `/api/contact/submit`
- **Role-based permission on page-edit** — `/api/ai/page-edit` now checks department from CF JWT; only `management` and `marketing` roles can use the endpoint (returns 403 for others)
- **File path exposure removed** — `/api/ai/page-edit` error responses use generic message instead of exposing server file paths

### Phase 9.3 — Pricing Bug Fixes (2026-02-16)
- **WAIT return deadhead fix** — return leg now uses base→destination distance (`destDeadhead`) instead of base→pickup; total WAIT miles use `deadhead + destDeadhead` instead of `deadhead × 2`
- **Airport arrival waiting rate fix** — uses charge-out rate (£17/hr) instead of driver wage (£13/hr), consistent with all other waiting time calculations
- **Per-leg minimum floor for different-day returns** — minimum fare (£35 private hire / £45 airport) now applies independently to each leg of a `separate` return, not to the combined total
- **DVSA passenger range parsing fix** — `parseInt("9-16")` was returning 9; now extracts maximum value from hyphenated ranges (e.g. "9-16" → 16)
- **DVSA break on one-way trips** — 45-minute break surcharge for 9+ passengers now applies to one-way trips too, not just WAIT returns

### Phase 9.2 — Pricing Refactor + Admin Cost Portal (2026-02-16)
- **Cost-based pricing model** for private hire — replaces baseFare + perMileRate with two admin-configurable inputs:
  - `costPerMile` (£0.45) — combined fuel + wear + insurance + depreciation + compliance
  - `chargeOutRatePerHour` (£17) — what we charge clients per driver hour (vs £13 driver wage)
- **Three-tier return pricing** for private hire:
  - **Split**: pickup near base + gap ≥ minGapForSplitReturnHours → driver returns to base between legs, zero waiting charge
  - **Wait**: pickup far from base OR short gap → driver stays at destination, waiting time charged at charge-out rate
  - **Separate**: different-day return → two independent bookings, surcharges applied per-leg based on each leg's date/time
- **Deadhead rolled into journey miles** — no separate "Driver travel from base" line; deadhead miles/hours included in Journey line
- **Admin pricing portal** at `/admin/pricing` — management-only, 7 sections:
  1. Core Pricing (costPerMile, chargeOutRate, driverWage + margin display)
  2. Operational Thresholds (deadhead threshold, min gap for split return)
  3. Minimum Booking Floors (private hire, airport)
  4. Passenger Multipliers (editable per band)
  5. Surcharges (editable percentages)
  6. Bank Holiday Dates (add/remove)
  7. DVSA Compliance (break threshold, duration, min passengers)
  8. Quote Preview panel (test quotes with current saved values)
- **API endpoints**: `GET /api/admin/pricing` (read config), `POST /api/admin/pricing` (write via GitHub API)
- **Airport transfers unchanged** — keeps fixed-rate model with airport rates table
- Updated passenger multipliers: 17-24 → 1.6 (was 1.7), 25-33 → 2.0 (was 2.1)
- DVSA config moved to top-level `dvsa` object (breakThresholdHours, breakDurationMinutes, minimumPassengers)

### Phase 9.1 — Quote Wizard Overhaul (2026-02-15/16)
- **Postcode/city autocomplete** on quote form text inputs via Postcodes.io API
  - Routing heuristic: `/^[A-Z]{1,2}\d/i` → postcode autocomplete endpoint; else → places search endpoint
  - Debounced 300ms, keyboard navigation (arrows, Enter, Escape), up to 8 suggestions
- **Real driving mileage** via Postcodes.io (lat/lng) + OSRM (road routing)
  - Replaces hardcoded 12-area distance matrix as primary distance source
  - Matrix retained as fallback when APIs fail
- **Driver hours pricing model** replacing flat 1.75x return multiplier for private hire:
  - **Same-day return**: outbound + return mileage + waiting time at £13/hr + deadhead + DVSA break
  - **Different-day return**: two one-way trips + double deadhead, return date + pickup time
  - **One-way**: unchanged core formula + deadhead if applicable
- **Driver deadhead from base**: nearest base (Birmingham B7 4JD / Manchester M35 0BR) → pickup; £13/hr x round trip if >30 miles
- **DVSA compliance**: 45-min break surcharge for 9+ passengers when total driving >4.5 hours
- **Conditional form fields** (`showWhen` system) — questions appear/hide based on other field values
  - Pickup time as actual time input, return journey reveals: same-day toggle, return pickup time, return date
- **Enterprise portal** — "Enterprise / Contract" badge, e-portal CTA, dynamic per-service descriptions
- **Luggage & accessibility**: luggage dropdown (none/light/heavy), wheelchair toggle for both services
- **Peak surcharges**: early morning (<07:00, +15%), late night (>22:00, +15%), Saturday (+10%), Sunday (+20%), bank holiday (+50%) — time + day/holiday stack additively
- **Multi-stop support**: up to 2 stops with postcode autocomplete, distance chained via OSRM, 10-min waiting per stop
- **Regular booking discount**: 10% off for recurring bookings (private-hire only)
- **Airport enhancements**: arrival/departure toggle (45-min waiting cost), executive vehicle class (+30% base), custom toggle labels
- **Minimum booking floors**: private-hire £35, airport £45
- **Itemised quote breakdown**: full cost breakdown table in Step 3
  - Line items: base journey, return, deadhead, waiting, DVSA break, stops, meet & greet, arrival waiting
  - Subtotal, surcharges (amber), regular discount (green), estimated total, price range
  - Flags: heavy luggage, wheelchair accessible, executive vehicle badges
- **Custom toggle labels** (`toggleLabels`) for "One-off"/"Regular", "Departure"/"Arrival" etc.
- **Competitive protection** — school names removed from area pages; replaced with regional SEND capability statements (e.g. "specialist SEND transport across the West Midlands"). Company-wide stats only (700+ students, 18+ years). Hospital names kept (public knowledge).
- **Contact form service pre-fill** — enterprise portal CTA links to `/contact?service=Service+Name`; ContactForm.astro reads the `service` URL parameter and pre-fills the message textarea with "I would like to request a consultation for [Service Name]."

### Phase 10 — Full Codebase Audit & Cleanup (2026-02-16/17)
Systematic audit of the entire codebase covering pricing, security, admin, accessibility, SEO, and project structure.

- Field validation on `/api/quote/estimate` (service key whitelist, string type, length limits)
- Distance matrix expanded: Sheffield (S), Leeds (LS), London (LDN) with full rows/columns
- London postcode areas (E, EC, N, NW, SE, SW, W, WC) mapped to LDN key
- Airport rates added for S, LS, LDN areas
- City lookup updated: sheffield→S, leeds→LS, london→LDN

**SEO fixes (4 issues):**
- Blog route: `[...slug].astro` → `[slug].astro` (prevents nested path matches)
- Blog post rendering: `post.render()` → `render(post)` (Astro v5 API)
- Blog slug resolution: `post.slug || post.id` (Astro v5 glob loader compat)
- Admin pages: `noindex, nofollow` meta tag via AdminLayout
- Blog index schema: `CollectionPage` with `ItemList` (done in prior session)
- Manchester postcode M35 0BR (done in prior session)

**Dependency audit:**
- 5 moderate lodash vulnerabilities (dev-only, @astrojs/check chain) — accepted risk

### Phase 11 — Pricing Intelligence System (2026-02-17)
Complete pipeline for quote tracking, conversion analytics, and AI-powered pricing recommendations.

**Quote Logging:**
- `src/lib/quote-log.ts` — append-only JSONL logger (mirrors audit-log.ts pattern, 5MB rotation)
- All website quotes (`/api/quote/estimate`) and James-chat quotes (`/api/chat`) logged automatically
- Log path: `data/quote-log.jsonl` (gitignored, persists on Railway)
- Privacy: first 4 chars of postcodes only, no IPs

**Conversion Tracking (`/admin/conversions`):**
- Dashboard metrics: weekly/monthly quotes, conversion rate, avg value, top routes, busiest days
- Filterable table: date range, service, source (website/james-chat/phone), status
- Slide-out panel: mark converted (booking value, customer name) or lost (reason)
- Manual phone booking entry form

### Phase 12 — Automated Monitoring Agents (2026-02-17)
5 automated monitoring agents with shared utilities, GitHub Actions workflows, email reports, and admin dashboard.

**Shared Infrastructure:**
- `scripts/agent-utils.mjs` — shared utility module: callHaiku, sendReportEmail (Resend), saveReport/loadReport, updateHistory (90-day cap), gradeFromIssues (A-F scale), fetchWithTimeout, createGitHubIssue, parseAIJSON, HTML email template helpers
- `scripts/run-all-agents.mjs` — convenience script to run all 7 agents in sequence (supports subset: `node scripts/run-all-agents.mjs security performance`)

**Security Agent (daily 3:00 UTC):**
- `scripts/security-agent.mjs` + `.github/workflows/security-agent.yml`
- Checks: auth enforcement on 5 admin endpoints (expects 401/403), security headers (6 headers across 4 pages), info leakage on 3 endpoints (server paths, stack traces, sensitive keywords), SSL/HTTPS status
- AI analysis via Haiku: summary, recommendations, risk level
- Creates GitHub issues on CRITICAL findings (unprotected admin endpoints, SSL failure)
- Always emails report via Resend

**SEO Agent (daily 4:00 UTC):**
- `scripts/seo-agent.mjs` + `.github/workflows/seo-agent.yml`
- Fetches sitemap-index.xml → crawls all sitemap URLs → checks each page for: HTTP status, title/description/OG meta tags, canonical, JSON-LD schema, response time
- Checks broken internal links (samples 30 unique paths from first 5 pages)
- AI analysis via Haiku: summary, recommendations, quick wins
- Always emails report via Resend

**Marketing Agent (weekly Monday 7:00 UTC):**
- `scripts/marketing-agent.mjs` + `.github/workflows/marketing-agent.yml`
- Reads blog posts (.md files), service pages, area pages, content calendar
- AI analysis via Haiku: content gaps (with priority), blog ideas (with target keywords), social media post suggestions (LinkedIn/Facebook), newsletter topics, content freshness assessment, overall assessment
- Grades based on blog freshness (30/60 day thresholds) and content gap count
- Always emails report via Resend

**Competitor Agent (weekly Sunday 21:00 UTC):**
- `scripts/competitor-agent.mjs` + `.github/workflows/competitor-agent.yml`
- Crawls 8 competitors (4 direct + 4 indirect) defined in `src/data/competitors.json`
- Checks `/`, `/services`, `/about`, `/contact` for each — extracts title, description, content hash (SHA-256 of body text)
- Compares hashes against `src/data/reports/competitor-hashes.json` to detect content changes
- AI analysis via Haiku: competitive landscape summary, per-competitor assessment (strengths/weaknesses/threat level), opportunities, recommendations
- Always emails report via Resend

**Performance Agent (daily 6:00 UTC):**
- `scripts/performance-agent.mjs` + `.github/workflows/performance-agent.yml`
- NO AI — pure programmatic checks
- Endpoint health: 12 public pages (status + response time), 4 admin pages (expects redirect/403), 1 API endpoint
- SSL verification, content integrity (keyword checks on 4 key pages)
- Only emails on failures (grade D or F) — no daily noise
- Workflow does NOT need `LLM_API_KEY`

**Report Files:**
- `src/data/reports/{security,seo,marketing,competitor,performance}-report.json` — latest report per agent
- `src/data/reports/history.json` — 90-day capped grade history for all agents (used by trend indicators)
- `src/data/reports/competitor-hashes.json` — content hash tracking for change detection across runs

**Admin Dashboard (`/admin/monitoring`):**
- Management-only page with 9-agent card grid (security, SEO, marketing, competitor, performance, pricing intelligence, compliance check, meta agent, remediation)
- Each card: grade badge (A-F with colour), trend indicator (improving/stable/declining), schedule, last run, AI-powered flag, expandable report details, "Run Now" button
- Agent Health tab: overview, per-agent assessments, recommendations, cost estimate (from meta agent)
- 90-day grade history table at bottom with recent grades and summaries
- AdminLayout nav updated with Monitoring link

**GitHub Actions:**
- All 9 workflows include `workflow_dispatch` for manual triggering
- Security agent has `issues: write` permission for GitHub issue creation
- All workflows auto-commit report files and push to main
- **Robust conflict handling** (2026-02-17): all 9 agent workflows use a shared commit step pattern — `git add -A`, stash local changes, `git pull --rebase` (with `--no-rebase` fallback if rebase fails), stash pop, re-add, commit, push with 5-second retry. Prevents failures when concurrent agents write to shared files (`notifications.json`, `history.json`). The `|| true` guards ensure the workflow never fails on the commit step — the agent has already run and sent emails successfully.

### Phase 12.1 — Security Headers Middleware (2026-02-17)
- `src/middleware.ts` — Astro middleware applying 6 security headers to every response (public, admin, API)

### Phase 12.2 — Notification System, Blog Auto-Drafting, Remediation Agent (2026-02-17)
- **Centralised notification system** (`src/lib/notifications.ts`) — createNotification, readNotifications, markAsRead, deleteNotification, stored in `src/data/notifications.json`
- **Blog auto-drafting** (`src/lib/blog-drafter.ts`) — AI generates weekly blog drafts from content calendar, saves to `src/data/blog-drafts.json`
- **Blog drafts API** (`src/pages/api/admin/blog-drafts.ts`) — GET list, PUT approve/reject/edit, POST publish (→ GitHub API)
- **Remediation agent** (`scripts/remediation-agent.mjs`) — reads security + SEO reports, pattern-matches HIGH/CRITICAL issues, generates plain English descriptions + Claude Code prompts (no AI, no code generation, no GitHub commits), auto-resolves when issues disappear, deduplicates by title
- **Proposed fixes API** (`src/pages/api/admin/proposed-fixes.ts`) — GET list, PUT dismiss
- Admin notification bell in AdminLayout header with unread count badge

- `src/pages/api/admin/social/publish-facebook.ts` — Facebook Graph API (returns setup instructions if tokens missing)
- `src/pages/admin/social.astro` — Admin page: create posts (AI generates from topic), filter by platform/status, edit/rewrite/approve/publish/reject/delete
- Blog publish hook: `blog-drafts.ts` auto-generates LinkedIn + Facebook drafts when a blog post is published, creates notification

**Meta Agent (Monthly):**
- `scripts/meta-agent.mjs` — Monthly agent health monitor: reads all agent scripts + latest reports, detects missed runs, AI analysis via Haiku (health assessment, recommendations, cost estimate, patterns), fallback if AI fails
- `.github/workflows/meta-agent.yml` — Monthly 1st 8:00 UTC cron + manual trigger
- Creates notification, sends email report, saves to `meta-report.json`

**Command Centre Dashboard:**
- `src/pages/admin/index.astro` — Rebuilt as Command Centre with:
  - 5 key metrics row (unread alerts, blog drafts, social drafts, pending fixes, site health grade)
  - "Needs Your Attention" section: pending notifications as colour-coded priority cards
  - Agent Status strip: Security, SEO, Performance, Compliance grades (management only)
  - Quick Actions sidebar (6 links with icons)
  - "Your Access" info panel
  - "Management Tools" section (management only)

**Other Updates:**
- `src/data/competitors.json` — Updated from 4 to 8 competitors (4 direct: Green Destinations, HATS Group, Travel SOS, Smart Kids Group; 4 indirect: AJ Travel, HS2 Travel, Aziz Coach Service, Aston Manor Coaches)
- AdminLayout nav updated with "Social" and "Fleet & DBS" links
- `scripts/run-all-agents.mjs` — Updated to include compliance + meta agents
- `/admin/monitoring` — Added Compliance Check and Meta Agent cards, Agent Health tab with overview/assessments/recommendations/cost

### Phase 12.4 — Security Hardening (2026-02-18)
- **robots.txt updated** — `Disallow: /admin/`, `Disallow: /api/`, `Disallow: /image-library`, `Disallow: /content-calendar`. Sitemap URL set to staging domain (change back to afjltd.co.uk at go-live).
- **CSP tightened** — Removed `'unsafe-eval'` from `script-src` directive in `src/middleware.ts`. `'unsafe-inline'` retained (required by Astro inline scripts and GA4). No source maps in production build.
- **Rate limiting on compliance endpoint** — `/api/compliance/status` now rate-limited at 30 req/15min per IP (was the only public endpoint without rate limiting). Uses existing `RATE_LIMITS.quote` pattern from `src/lib/rate-limit.ts`.

### Phase 12.5 — Run Agents from Admin Dashboard (2026-02-18) ← LATEST
- **Run Now buttons** on every agent card in `/admin/monitoring` — trigger any of the 9 agents on-demand
- **`POST /api/admin/run-agent`** — new endpoint: accepts `{ agent: 'security' | 'seo' | 'remediation' | ... }`, management only, uses `child_process.exec` to run the corresponding script with 120s timeout
- Agent name → script mapping: security→security-agent.mjs, seo→seo-agent.mjs, remediation→remediation-agent.mjs, marketing→marketing-agent.mjs, competitor→competitor-agent.mjs, performance→performance-agent.mjs, pricing→market-research-agent.mjs, compliance→compliance-check-agent.mjs, meta→meta-agent.mjs
- Simple in-memory lock prevents overlapping runs (returns 409 if another agent is already running)
- UI: loading spinner with pulse animation, all other Run Now buttons disabled while one runs, page reloads on success to show fresh report, error alert on failure
- **Report persistence fix** — Railway filesystem resets on redeploy, so agent reports written to disk would be lost. After script execution, `run-agent.ts` reads all output files from disk and commits each to GitHub via `updateFileContent()` from `src/lib/github.ts`. This triggers a Railway redeploy with the new data baked in.
  - Per-agent files: security→`security-report.json`, seo→`seo-report.json`, remediation→`remediation-report.json`+`proposed-fixes.json`, marketing→`marketing-report.json`+`blog-drafts.json`, competitor→`competitor-report.json`+`competitor-hashes.json`, performance→`performance-report.json`, pricing→`pricing-report.json`, compliance→`compliance-check-report.json`+`compliance-dedup.json`+`compliance-records.json`, meta→`meta-report.json`
  - Shared files committed after every run: `src/data/reports/history.json`, `src/data/notifications.json`
  - Response includes `committedFiles` count; individual file commit failures are logged but don't fail the response

### Phase 13 — Future Integration (PLANNED, pending Telemex)
- Council self-service portal with route and student data
- Parent notification system (real-time transport updates)
- Fleet performance dashboard with live data

## 6. Security Model

### Authentication
| Route Pattern | Auth Method | Who |
|---------------|------------|-----|
| `/admin/*` | Cloudflare Zero Trust (email-based) | AFJ managers by department |
| `/api/*` (from admin) | Cloudflare Access JWT (verified via jose JWKS) | Authenticated managers |
| `/api/*` (programmatic) | `DASHBOARD_SECRET` header | Automated scripts, Claude Code |
| `/api/contact/submit` | Rate limited (5/15min per IP) | Public |
| `/api/quote/estimate` | Rate limited (30/15min per IP) + field validation | Public |
| `/api/compliance/status` | Rate limited (30/15min per IP) | Public |
| `/image-library` | Cloudflare Zero Trust | Jay only |
| `/content-calendar` | Cloudflare Zero Trust | Jay only |
| All other routes | Public | Everyone |

All API endpoints validate request body size (50KB default, 200KB for large content).
All admin API endpoints use `authenticateRequest()` from `src/lib/cf-auth.ts`.
All responses include security headers via `src/middleware.ts` (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy).
`public/robots.txt` blocks `/admin/`, `/api/`, `/image-library`, `/content-calendar` from crawlers. No source maps in production build.

### Secret Management
- All secrets stored as Railway environment variables (never committed to repo)
- `DASHBOARD_SECRET` rotated quarterly
- GitHub PAT scoped to repo-only access
- LLM API keys have usage limits set at provider level

### Data Protection
- No user data stored in the repository
- Contact form submissions go directly to Web3Forms (GDPR compliant)
- Cloudflare handles SSL termination
- No cookies beyond essential GDPR consent cookie and Cloudflare access cookie
